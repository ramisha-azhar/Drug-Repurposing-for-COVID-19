```

SARS and COVID-19 are closely related because they’re caused by very similar coronaviruses.

- **SARS** (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) was caused by **SARS-CoV-1** and emerged in **2002–2003**.
- **COVID-19** is caused by **SARS-CoV-2**, which appeared in **2019**.

Both viruses come from the **coronavirus family**,Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the SARS virus, which is why COVID-19 has “SARS” in its scientific name—even though COVID-19 spreads much more easily worldwide. Studying SARS has helped scientists better understand COVID-19’s transmission, symptoms, and prevention strategies.

## Background: COVID-19

- as we know **COVID-19** is caused by **SARS-CoV-2**, an enveloped positive-strand RNA virus affecting the respiratory system.
- The global population was **immune-naïve**, leading to rapid spread and high morbidity and mortality.
- Traditional drug development (12–15 years, very expensive) is **too slow** for a pandemic.
- **Drug repurposing** is a realistic and fast alternative: reuse FDA-approved drugs with known safety profiles.

## Drug Repurposing (DR)

- **Drug repurposing** is the process of identifying new therapeutic uses for existing drugs. By leveraging known safety profiles and mechanisms of action, this approach reduces development time and cost, making it especially valuable for rapidly responding to emerging disease
- **Advantages**:
    - Faster and cheaper than de novo drug discovery
    - Known toxicity and side effects

## Network Medicine for drug repurposing

one of the computational approach  for drug repurposing is the network analysis

### Human Interactome

- The **human interactome** is the complete network of:
    - Physical molecular interactions between proteins
- Represented as a graph:
    - Nodes = proteins
    - Edges = interactions

### Disease Modules

- Disease-associated genes are **not randomly distributed**
- They form **localized clusters**, called:
    - **Disease modules**
- Perturbations in these modules lead to disease phenotypes

### Drug Action in Network Medicine

- Drugs act as **local perturbations** in the interactome
- A drug can:
    - Be therapeutically effective
    - Cause off-target side effects
- Effectiveness depends on:
    - Proximity of drug targets to disease modules

> A drug is more likely to treat a disease if its targets are within or close to the disease module in the interactome
> 

## SAveRUNNER Algorithm

- **SAveRUNNER** is a new **network-medicine-based algorithm** for drug repurposing.
- It constructs a bipartite drug–disease network by quantifying the interplay between the drug targets and the disease-specific proteins in the human interactome via a **novel network-based similarity measure** that prioritizes associations between drugs and diseases locating in the same network neighborhoods.
- **SAveRUNNER** yielded a high accuracy in the identification of well-known drug indications, thus revealing itself as a powerful tool to rapidly highlight potential novel medical indications for various drugs, which are already approved and used in clinical practice, against the new human coronavirus.
- Identify potential **off-label drug–disease associations**
- Builds a **weighted bipartite network**:
    - One set of nodes: drugs
    - Other set of nodes: diseases
- Successfully identifies:
    - Known drug indications
    - Novel repurposing candidates for COVID-19

## Data Sources and Inputs of **SAveRUNNER**

### 1. Human Interactome

- Nodes: **15,970 proteins**
- Edges: **217,160 interactions**
- **Source:** Cheng et al., Nature Communications (2018)

**input_files → Supplementary_data1.txt**

### 2. Disease Data

- **14 diseases** related to COVID-19 has **874 disease genes**
- it is SARS-related disease genes
- **Source :** phenopedia

SARS-CoV-2 Targets i.e covid 19

- **332 human proteins**
- Identified via affinity purification mass spectrometry
- Interact with **26 viral proteins**
- **Source :** Data from Gordon et al. (2020)

we selected these 14 diseases based on

- Genetic similarity
- Comorbidity
- Therapeutic relevance

<img width="315" height="312" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/621c6985-201b-40ee-84e0-bd15ca6cf91d" />


### 3. Drug Data

- **1,875 FDA-approved drugs**
- **2,166 drug targets**
- **Source:** DrugBank

we modify our DrugBank.txt file by adding combination of drugs

We assembled target information for a total of **1875 FDA-approved drugs**.

Despite significant progress in the COVID-19 management pointing to **remdesivir** as the most promising therapeutic candidate, the mortality remains high, indicating that treatment with an antiviral drug alone is not likely to be sufficient and combinations of antiviral agents should be evaluated by future strategies to improve patient outcomes in COVID-19.

Thus, we considered **combination** of drugs whose antiviral action against coronavirus infections has been demonstrated both **in vitro and in vivo studies**:

❖ **5-cocktail**: combination of **remdesivir** with other four antiviral agents (**hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, lopinavir, and ritonavir**)

❖ **kaletra**: combination of **lopinavir and ritonavir**

**input_files → DrugBank.txt**

<img width="302" height="315" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e023913-e473-4f87-9be6-7d5bc04b1d96" />


## Diseases Considered

Included diseases:

1. SARS (highest genomic similarity to SARS-CoV-2)
2. Cardiovascular diseases
3. Diabetes
4. Hypertension
5. Malaria
6. HIV
7. Ebola
8. Rheumatoid arthritis

Rationale:

- Strong comorbidity with COVID-19
- Drugs already used for these diseases are being tested for COVID-19

## Working Hypothesis of SAveRUNNER

- For a drug to be effective against a disease:
    - **Drug module (T)** and **Disease module (S)** must be **close in the interactome**
- Inputs:
    1. Drug–target network , source : DrugBank
    2. Disease–gene network, source :phenopedia

**SAveRUNNER** takes as input the list of drug targets and the list of disease genes. These lists can be represented as networks: (i) a drug–target network, within which nodes are drugs and target proteins, linked if the protein is a known target of the drug; and (ii) a disease–gene network, within which nodes are diseases and genes, linked if the gene has been associated to the disease.

## SAveRUNNER Methodology

<img width="842" height="607" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab5a0de8-b315-4bd3-8c08-5472e5bbb442" />

### Step 1: Network Proximity

<img width="412" height="147" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57e3ea28-59a3-4e8c-bf31-92b10930f731" />

- Measures average shortest path length between:
    - Drug Module (T)
    - Nearest set of disease genes in the disease module (S)
- Proximity formula:
    - Average minimum distance between drug targets and disease genes
- Statistical significance:
- Degree-preserving randomization
- 1,000 simulations
- Z-score and p-value calculation

To evaluate the **statistical significance** of the observed network proximity between the two modules *T* and *S*, SAveRUNNER builds a reference distance distribution corresponding to the expected distance between two randomly selected groups of proteins with the same size and degree distribution of the original sets of disease proteins and drug targets in the human interactome.

This procedure is repeated 1,000 times and the observed value for the proximity was z-score normalized by using the mean and the standard deviation of the reference distance distribution, in order to obtain a p-value for the corresponding *z* statistics.

here we compute just the proximity not the p value we consider all the interaction among diseases and drug

in the script **mainStartNetwork()** it will compute the proximity

 The file "the Drug_Disease_newtork.txt" at the same level of "src" folder
 
<img width="382" height="287" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9493cab-faab-4db4-825b-833ef3d2b34d" />

---

### Step 2: Network Similarity

- Converts proximity into similarity score ∈ [0,1]

<img width="386" height="166" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88282f76-7d0f-4bb3-ad31-bfef12886557" />

p stands for network proximity

- Interpretation:

**Null similarity** means that the corresponding disease and drug modules are **very distal** in the human interactome (i.e., *p* is maximum); whereas **maximum similarity** means that the corresponding disease and drug modules are **very proximal** in the human interactome (i.e., *p* equal to zero).

- Similarity ≈ 0 → modules far apart
- Similarity ≈ 1 → modules close

---

### Step 3: p-value Filtering

- Only drug–disease pairs with:
    - **p ≤ 0.05**
- Ensures associations are not random
- with this we form the **drug disease network** after computing network proximity and have statistically significant link between them

---

### Step 4: Cluster Detection

- we compute quality score for each cluester
- SAveRUNNER performs a cluster analysis to detect groups of drugs and diseases in such a way that members in the same group (cluster) are more similar to each other than to those in other groups (clusters).
- SAveRUNNER exploits a cluster detection algorithm based on the **greedy optimization of the network modularity**. Specifically, modularity measures the strength of network division into clusters, i.e. networks with high modularity have dense connections between the nodes within clusters but sparse connections between nodes in different clusters. The greedy clustering algorithm was adopted in view of its good performance and high speed in detecting community structure from very large networks.
- The quality of each cluster is evaluated by SAveRUNNER by computing the following **quality cluster (QC) score**:

<img width="341" height="166" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8fbf5cd1-26a3-43ec-b71b-42facf2ea174" />


- Internal edge weight
- External connectivity
- Node density

W_in denotes the total weight of edges within the cluster

W_out denotes the total weight of edges connecting this cluster to the rest of network

P is a penalty term which considers the node density within the clu

---

### Step 5: Adjustment of network similarity

*we can increase the similarity of our drug and disease if they are found in the same cluester or community with the help of the quality score of the cluster*

*which tell us that the drug can be effectively repurposed for that disease*

<img width="362" height="84" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/33f019b9-b702-45c4-98ec-f9b8545af4ed" />

- If drug and disease are in the **same cluster**:
    - Similarity score is increased
- Reflects biological plausibility
- Adjusted similarity may exceed 1 which means we lose bound range

       [0,1 ] so we need to normalize again

#select significative drug-disease association and (or not) adjust

#we will get adjusted similarity drug disease network
**mainEndNetwork()**

---

### Step 6: Normalization of network similarity

- Applies sigmoid function to:

        Bound values between 0 and 1

- Produces final similarity score
- Output:
    - **Weighted bipartite drug–disease network**

<img width="875" height="567" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a556660-b0c4-4520-9723-aeac2bf77f7c" />

*if adjusted similarity is more than **d** then the drugs and disease are proximal drugs here are reliable and we can use as repurposing it also help us shortened our list among approved drug from Drug Bank and give us repurposing drug*

*and if adjusted similarity is less than d which is sigmoid midpoint it means the drug and disease are in the same cluester but they are map far in the interactome* 

*so we see sigmoid function help us to normalize which means bound our adjusted similarity value among 0 and 1 [0,1]* 

---

## Results

- we have Final network
- Identified:
    - Known drug indications
    - Novel candidate drugs for SARS and SARS-CoV-2
- Confirms:
    - Combination therapies are more promising than single drugs

SAveRUNNER offers a list of predicted/prioritized associations between drugs and diseases as a **weighted bipartite drug–disease network**, in which one set of nodes corresponds to drugs and the other one corresponds to diseases. A link between a drug and a disease occurs if the corresponding drug targets and disease genes are nearby in the interactome more than expected by chance (p-value ≤ 0.05) and the weight of their interaction corresponds to the adjusted and normalized similarity value.

This **drug–disease network heat map** visualizes how strongly different **diseases are associated with drugs** based on network similarity in the human interactome.

- **Rows = diseases**
    (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, COVID-19, Hemorrhagic Fever/Ebola)
  
- **Columns = drugs**

- **Colors represent similarity strength** between a drug and a disease:
    - 🟨 **Yellow (high values ~0.8–1)** strong drug–disease similarity
    - 🟦 **Blue (low values ~0)** weak or no association similarity

- The **dendrograms** (tree structures) group together diseases and drugs with **similar interaction patterns**.
- **SARS and COVID-19 cluster closely**, indicating they share similar network-based drug associations, which makes sense biologically because both are caused by related coronaviruses.
- **Ebola** appears more distant, reflecting different molecular mechanisms and fewer shared drug targets.
  
- Drugs that show **high similarity (yellow)** for both SARS and COVID-19 are strong **candidates for drug repurposing**.
- The heatmap highlights how network-based methods can prioritize drugs likely to work across related diseases.
- This heatmap shows that COVID-19 and SARS have similar drug interaction profiles, supporting the use of network medicine to identify repurposable drugs for emerging viral diseases.

    total drugs associated with each disease.
    
- **44 shared drugs between SARS and COVID-19**
     strong overlap, indicating similar drug-disease network profiles.
    
- **Very few shared drugs with Ebola only 1**
     Ebola is biologically and therapeutically distinct.
    
SARS and COVID-19 cluster closely and share many predicted drugs, while Ebola is clearly separated, supporting the idea that network-based drug repurposing captures meaningful biological relationships between related diseases.

## TTD
The Therapeutic Target Database (TTD) is a curated resource that links drugs to their molecular targets and therapeutic indications. In drug repurposing studies, TTD is commonly used to validate predicted drug–disease associations by comparing network-based predictions with known clinical indications, thereby supporting on-label validation and identifying potential repurposing candidates.

### on-label and off-label drugs
An on-label drug is approved for the treatment of a specific disease, whereas an off-label drug is an approved drug used for a disease outside its officially approved indication. In drug repurposing studies, off-label drugs represent promising candidates for novel diseases, while on-label drugs are commonly used for validation of computational predictions.

In this study, off-label drugs are identified as candidate therapies based on their close proximity to the disease module in the interactome. These drugs are not currently approved for the disease of interest but are predicted to be relevant due to shared molecular pathways. In contrast, on-label drugs are used primarily for validation purposes. By comparing predicted drug–disease associations with known approved indications, the analysis assesses whether the network-based approach is able to recover established therapeutic relationships, thereby increasing confidence in the newly predicted off-label candidates.

### input files

**- TTD_association.txt**

The file TTD_association.txt contains curated drug–disease associations obtained from the Therapeutic Target Database. Each entry links a drug to a disease for which it has an established therapeutic indication. In this study, this file is used as a reference dataset to validate network-based drug–disease predictions by identifying drugs that are already approved for specific diseases. The integration of TTD associations enables on-label validation and supports the interpretation of predicted off-label drug candidates.

TTD_association.txt provides known clinical drug indications and is used to validate network-based drug repurposing predictions.

Typically, each row in TTD_association.txt includes:

- Disease / therapeutic indication
(the disease a drug is approved to treat)

- Drug name
  
One row = one known drug–disease relationship

**-  Drug_Disease_network.txt**

this file has the statistically significant drug disease associations network of our disease of interest which is COVID-19 according to the significance level which is  pvalues(default:p-value≤0.05) it returns the proximity and similarity of drug-disease network 

### output file
**-  onLabel_COVID-19_drug.txt**

These are on-label drugs used to validate COVID-19 drug predictions.

The file onLabel_COVID-19_drug.txt contains drugs that are both predicted to be associated with COVID-19 through network-based analysis and already have known therapeutic indications according to the Therapeutic Target Database. This file represents the on-label validation set, used to assess whether the network approach can recover established drug–disease relationships. The inclusion of proximity, statistical significance, and similarity metrics enables quantitative evaluation of each drug’s relevance to COVID-19 at the molecular network level.

onLabel_COVID-19_drug.txt validates the drug repurposing method by showing that known drugs appear close to the COVID-19 disease module in the network.

 ## Cytoscape
 
this Cytoscape network represents drug–disease associations constructed using an adjusted similarity measure that quantifies the strength of the relationship between drugs and diseases.

In the network, nodes represent biological entities, where red nodes correspond to diseases (such as COVID-19 and Ebola) and the surrounding colored nodes represent drugs or chemical compounds. Edges denote associations between a drug and a disease based on similarity analysis.

The color of the edges encodes the magnitude of the adjusted similarity measure. Yellow edges indicate strong similarity, reflecting a high degree of overlap between drugs and diseases in terms of molecular targets . In contrast, blue edges represent weaker similarity, indicating more indirect or lower-confidence associations and we can also see the drugs that are shared among the different diseases
